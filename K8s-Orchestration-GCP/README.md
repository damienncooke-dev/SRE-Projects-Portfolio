# Kubernetes Fundamentals: Deploying the Docker Voting App on GKE

This project demonstrates foundational Kubernetes operational concepts such as deployment, service discovery, 
persistent storage, health monitoring, and troubleshooting using Docker's Example Voting App Microservice. 
The purpose of this project was to build and strengthen practical Site Reliability Engineering skills and show production-readiness thinking.

---

## Why This Project

GitLab Dedicated provisions and operates **isolated, single-tenant GitLab environments** for customers at scale. The team's core challenge is making many environments reliable, consistent, and automatable — using Kubernetes as the operational backbone.

This project demonstrates the foundational Kubernetes skills that underpin that work: deploying multi-service workloads, managing configuration separately from code, exposing services reliably, and understanding what to do when things go wrong.

---

## Application Stack (Pre-Built — Not Modified)
The YAML manifests (Pods, Services, Deployments) live in this repository. The application code is not the focus — the **Kubernetes operational layer** is.

**Time to complete:** ~2 days  
**Cloud provider:** Google Cloud Platform (GKE)  
**Application:** [Docker Example Voting App Microservice](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app)

| Component | Technology | Role |
|---|---|---|
| vote | Python | Frontend voting UI |
| redis | Redis | In-memory vote queue |
| worker | .NET | Processes votes from Redis to PostgreSQL |
| db | PostgreSQL | Persistent vote store |
| result | Node.js | Displays vote results |

## 3. Cluster Setup — GKE

**Concept:** A Kubernetes cluster is the foundation — a set of nodes (VMs) managed by a control plane that schedules and runs your workloads.

GKE is a *managed* Kubernetes service: Google operates the control plane, you manage what runs on it. 

### Create the Cluster

Cluster creation is a one-time process done through the GCP Dashboard.
1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Provide loging and authorization credentials.
3. From the main navigation menu in the upper left hand corner, select **Kubernetes Engine**.
4. In this space you will create a standard GKE cluster. If asked **Enable Kubernetes API**.
5. Select **Create Cluster**. (See alternate instructions below for manual cluster creation)
6. Your default cluster will be the "GKE AutoPilot Cluster", in the upper right hand corner select **Switch to Standard Cluster**.
7. Provide a name for your cluster: [`vote-app-deployment`].
8. Provide a region, in this case keep default "Zonal:" [`us-central1`]. (Free tier status does not allow for regional clusters due to quota limits)
9. Configure the following under Node Pool "default-pool" and "Nodes" settings:
   * **[default-pool]: Node Count:** 3
   * **[default-pool]: Enable Spot VMs** (VMs can be reclaimed at any time)
   * **[Nodes]: Machine Type:** `General Purpose, e2-small(2 vCPUs, 1 core, 2 GB RAM)`
   * **[Nodes]: Disk Size:** `10` GB
10. Click **Create**.
11. Cluster creation can take a few minutes. 
12. After successful creation of the cluster, you will the cluster details in the dashboard with 3 nodes, 6 virtual CPUs, and 12 GB of RAM. 
13. To see node details, click on the cluster name and select the tab **Nodes**.


Alternatively, the GCP Cloud Shell can be used to create the cluster starting from step 5 above. 
1. From the upper right hand corner of the dashboard, select **Cloud Shell**.
2. Once the shell initializes, enter the following command:
```bash
ggcloud container clusters create voting-app-deployment \
    --zone=us-central1-a \
    --num-nodes=3 \
    --machine-type=e2-small \
    --spot \
    --disk-size=30
    
```
3. After successful creation of the cluster, you will see the cluster details in the dashboard with 3 nodes, 6 vCPUs, 6 GB of memory.


### Connect kubectl to the Cluster
1. The cluster can be accessed via the `gcloud` CLI utility.
2. From the UI menu at the top, select **Connect** and choose **Command-line access** and **Run in Cloud Shell**.
3. The GCP Cloud Shell will open up and will be pre-prompted with the command to connect `kubectl` to the cluster.
```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials voting-app-deployment --zone us-central1-a --project <accept-default-project-id>
```

### Verify the Cluster is Healthy
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
```
💡 Pro Tip: It gets very tiresome typing 'kubectl' all the time...

alias k='kubectl'

k get nodes

```
Expected output: three nodes in `Ready` status.

```
NAME                                   STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
gke-voting-cluster-default-pool-...   Ready    <none>   2m    v1.28.x
gke-voting-cluster-default-pool-...   Ready    <none>   2m    v1.28.x
gke-voting-cluster-default-pool-...   Ready    <none>   2m    v1.28.x
```

### Clone the release 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damienncooke-dev/Orchestration-Project.git
```
---
<br>

## 4. Namespaces — Logical Isolation

**Concept:** Namespaces divide a cluster into isolated virtual workspaces. In GitLab Dedicated, different tenant environments live in isolated spaces — this is a foundational pattern, even at small scale.

### Create the Namespace
```bash
kubectl create namespace voting
```

### Set it as the Default for This Session
```bash
# See the contexts available
kubectl config get-contexts

# Set the current context to the namespace
kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=voting
```

> **Why this matters:** Without namespaces, everything lands in `default`. In a team or multi-tenant environment, we need to isolate workloads from each other.

### Verify
```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```
**For the rest of this project, we will not specify the namespace since it is set as the current context.**

## 5. Deploying the Application

**Concepts:** Deployments declare the *desired state* of a workload — how many replicas, which image, what resources. Kubernetes continuously works to match reality to that declaration. ReplicaSets are created automatically by the Deployment to maintain the replica count.


### Apply All Deployments
```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/K8s-Orchestration-GCP/K8s-app-deploy-test/manifests/Deployments/ 
```

### Watch the Pods Come Up
```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```

Wait until all pods show `Running` with `1/1` under `READY`. Ctrl-C to stop watching.

## Uh-oh! 
### Inspect a Deployment

```bash
kubectl get depoyments 
```

```
The db deployment is failing to start! 

NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
db       0/1     1            0           3m28s
redis    1/1     1            1           3m28s
result   1/1     1            1           3m28s
vote     1/1     1            1           3m28s
worker   1/1     1            1           3m28s

...checking the pod events

(~)$ kubectl get pods

NAME                      READY   STATUS                       RESTARTS   AGE

(~)$ kubectl describe db-5867dd7898-8lmp2

Events:
  Type     Reason     Age                   From               Message
  ----     ------     ----                  ----               -------
  Normal   Scheduled  6m33s                 default-scheduler  Successfully assigned voting/db-5867dd7898-8lmp2 to gke-voting-app-deploymen-default-pool-02a1fe9b-lj02

 The secres has not been created yet, and this is expected. It will be addressed in an upcoming section (seting 7).

```

Note the sections: desired replicas, current replicas, image, events. This is the first place to look when something isn't working.

### Key Relationship to Understand With Deployments

Deployments manage ReplicaSets and the desired number of pods running in the cluster.

```
Deployment (desired state: 2 replicas of vote)
    └── ReplicaSet (maintains 2 pods)
            ├── Pod (vote-abc123)
            └── Pod (vote-def456)
```

If you delete a pod manually, the ReplicaSet creates a replacement immediately. Try it:
```bash
# Scale up the voting app to 2 replicas
kubectl scale deployment vote --replicas=2 

# Get a pod name
kubectl get pods   # Two pods are now running

# Delete it  
kubectl delete pod <vote-pod-name>   # Note the last 5 digits of the pod name

# Watch it get recreated 
kubectl get pods -w  # Ctrl-C to stop watching.

```
The pod will be recreated with a new name. This demonstrates that 2 pods will always be running.

## 6. Services — Internal and External Networking

**Concept:** Pods are temporary and get new IP addresses when restarted. Services provide a stable network endpoint in front of pods, using label selectors to find the right pods automatically.

There are two types in use here:
- **ClusterIP** — internal only, for pod-to-pod communication (Redis, PostgreSQL, worker)
- **LoadBalancer** — provisions a cloud load balancer with an external IP (vote UI, result UI)

> For development of the manifests in a local environment, the type 'NodePort' is used.  For GCP deployments, the type is changed to 'LoadBalancer'. This tells GCP to provision an external load balancer and expose this service to the internet.<br>
<br>
> In the Service manifests for voting and results, set the type to `loadBalancer` 


```bash
vi ~/K8s-Orchestration-GCP/K8s-app-deploy-test/manifests/Services/vote-service.yaml   # Change the type to LoadBalancer
vi ~/K8s-Orchestration-GCP/K8s-app-deploy-test/manifests/Services/result-service.yaml  # Change the type to LoadBalancer
```

### Apply Services
```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/K8s-Orchestration-GCP/K8s-app-deploy-test/manifests/Services/ 
```

### Verify
```bash
kubectl get services -A | grep -E 'NAMESPACE|voting'
```

The vote and result services will show an `EXTERNAL-IP`. It may take 1–2 minutes for GCP to provision the load balancer.

When the external IPs are visible, you can view in a browser by going to the IP address using port 8080. The following images will be displayed:

| Voting App         | Result App         |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| <img width="392" height="268" alt="Screenshot 2026-06-20 at 6 58 10 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0249278f-e85c-4600-ab65-347c25843b12" /> |  <img width="392" height="268" alt="Screenshot 2026-06-20 at 6 58 20 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85b3b16c-ae9e-43d3-80a1-88d4a6982527" />|


### At this point, the voting results will not update due to the lack of secret information. That will be addressed in the next section.

---
<br>


## 7. ConfigMaps and Secrets

**Concept:** Configuration and credentials should never be baked into container images. ConfigMaps hold non-sensitive config. Secrets hold sensitive values (passwords, tokens). Both inject values into pods at runtime, keeping images portable and environment-agnostic.

### Create a ConfigMap for Redis Hostname

In this section, injecting configuration into the redis deployment is demonstrated. A configmap is created, and the deployment is updated to reference the name of the configmap. **The change has no functional relevance** but will show how the environment setting is in place by viewing the environment variables on the pod.
```bash
kubectl create configmap app-config \
  --from-literal=REDIS_HOST=redis \
  -n voting
```
...update the deployment [`~/Orchestration-Project/K8s-app-deploy/Deployments/redis-app-deployment.yaml`] to reference the configmap
```yaml
containers:
  - name: 
    ...
    envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: app-config
```
...apply the changes for the deployment to pick up the environment variable...

```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/K8s-Orchestration-GCP/K8s-app-deploy-test/manifests/Deployments/redis-app-deployment.yaml 

```
...check pod status...
```bash
kubectl get pods 

```

...ssh into the redis pod and check the environment variables...

```bash
# Exec into a running pod
kubectl exec -it <redis-pod-name>  -- /bin/sh
```
```bash
# grep the environment variables
env | grep REDIS_HOST

```

...the environment variable REDIS_HOST is set to `redis` <br>
<br>


### Create a Secret for PostgreSQL Credentials

A secret YAML file is already created for this project.   The data inside the file is base64-encoded.  Once the secret is created, the voting app should begin to work.

```yaml
# ~/K8s-Orchestration-GCP/K8s-app-deploy-test/manifests/Secrets/db-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
   name: db-secrets
data:
 POSTGRES_USER: cG9zd....
 POSTGRES_PASSWORD: cG9zd...
 
 # Not actual base64-encoded values. 

```

> **Note:** Kubernetes Secrets are base64-encoded, not encrypted. In production (including GitLab Dedicated), secrets are backed by cloud KMS (GCP Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault). This project demonstrates the Kubernetes-native pattern; the cloud-native enhancement is the next step.
<br>


### Create 
```bash
kubectl create -f ~/K8s-Orchestration-GCP/K8s-app-deploy-test/manifests/Secrets/db-secrets.yaml

```

### Verify
```bash
kubectl get secrets 

# Inspect (values are base64-encoded, not plaintext)
kubectl describe secret db-credentials -n voting
```

### Reference in a Deployment (example)

| Voting App | Result App |
|------------|------------|
|<img width="392" height="268" alt="Screenshot 2026-06-20 at 8 54 08 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c01dade8-d20c-45e3-9a17-957a1204c514" /> |  <img width="392" height="268" alt="Screenshot 2026-06-20 at 8 53 59 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dcb37ce-7dd0-48de-86b9-44b33dde2493" /> |

## 8. Persistent Storage for PostgreSQL

**Concept:** Pods are ephemeral — when a pod is deleted, its local storage is gone with it. PostgreSQL needs to retain data across pod restarts. PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) request durable storage from the cluster; GKE provisions a GCP Persistent Disk automatically.

### Apply the PVC
```yaml
# manifests/pvc/postgres-pvc.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: db-pvc
  namespace: voting
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/K8s-Orchestration-GCP/K8s-app-deploy-test/manifests/pvc/db-pvc.yaml 
kubectl get pvc
```

Watch the STATUS column change from `Pending` to `Bound`. GKE is dynamically provisioning the disk.

```
NNAME     STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   AGE
db-pvc    Bound    pvc-b68773be-9464-4b5c-93fa-a41a8091086b   1Gi        RWO            standard-rwo   <unset>                 15m

```

### Mount it in the PostgreSQL Deployment
```yaml
volumes:
  - name: postgres-storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: db-pvc
containers:
  - name: db
    env:
      - name: DBDATA
        value: /var/lib/postgresql/data/dbdata
    volumeMounts:
      - name: postgres-storage
        mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
        subPath: dbdata

```

### Verify Persistence
```bash
# Cast a few votes through the UI, then delete the db pod
kubectl delete pod <db-pod-name> 

# Kubernetes recreates it, reattaching the same PVC
kubectl get pods -w


```
### Open the result UI — votes should still be there

**NOTE: There has been instances where the result UI will not reconnect to DB and will need to be restarted also. When it does, the data is persisted and the previous result is still available.**
```bash
# If the result UI has not updated after the db has restarted.
kubectl delete pod <results-pod-name> 

```

## 9. Health Checks — Liveness and Readiness Probes

**Concept:** Kubernetes doesn't know if your application is actually healthy just because the process is running. Probes let you define what "healthy" means. Readiness probes control whether a pod receives traffic. Liveness probes restart a broken pod. 

In the following example, we will demonstrate the Readiness Probe only.  We will first create 2 voting app deployment yaml files and demonstrate what happens when a pod is not ready to receive traffic. Then we will add the readiness probe to the pod that is failing to receive traffic. This will show how the readiness probe will prevent traffic to the failing or delayed pod and indicate a warning that the readiness check failed.
<br>

### Create two voting app yaml files

* Copy voting-app-deployment.yaml to voting-app2-deployment.yaml
* Rename voiting-app-deployment.yaml to voting-app1-deployment.yaml



### Update voting app deployment yaml files
* **voting-app1-deployment.yaml**
    * Change metadata.name to `vote1`
    * Add a command to insert a sleep command to the container startup command.
  
```yaml
# Change to 'vote1'
metadata:
  name: vote1
---
# Add 'command' and 'args' under spec.template.spec.containers
spec:
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      initContainers:
        - name: 
          ...
      containers:
        - name: vote
          ...
          command: ["/bin/sh"]
          args:
            - "-c"
            - "sleep 300"
  
```
* **voting-app2-deployment.yaml**
    *  * Change metadata.name to `vote2`
  
```yaml
# Change to 'vote2'
metadata:
  name: vote2
---
```
<br>

### Execute test by creating deployment

* Executing this step will require that these necessary dependencies are met.
   * Configmap for Redis Hostname
   * Secret for PostgreSQL Credentials
   * PVC for PostgreSQL
   * LoadBalancer configured for the vote service type


* Create a persistent curl shell to issue the curl command to the voting app to see where the request is being sent.
```bash
kubectl run curl --image=curlimages/curl -it -- sh

# Exit out of the shell after it is created
exit
```
* Create a deployment and wait for all pod STATUS to say "Running" and  READY to say "1/1"
```bash
kubectl create -f ~/K8s-Orchestration-GCP/K8s-app-deploy-test/manifests/Deployments/

# Monitor the deployment
kubectl get pods
```
...the pod output should look like this...

```

* Once the deployment is in the current state, run the curl command to see where the request is being sent.
```bash
# Get the external IP of the vote service
kubectl get svc

# Note the EXTERNAL-IP of the vote service and insert into the following command
for i in {1..500}; do
kubectl exec curl -it -- sh -c 'test=`wget -qO- -T 2  http://<EXTERNAL-IP>:8080 2>&1 | grep -E "container ID"` && echo "$test OK" || echo "Failed"'
done
```
```
# After running the command and observe your output is similar to this:

NOTE - that all the requests are being sent to the vote2 pod and failing on the vote1 pod

```


### Add Readiness Probe to the vote1 Deployment
* Delete the vote1 deployment
```bash
kubectl delete deploy vote1
```
* Update the vote1 deployment under spec.template.spec.containers to include the readiness probe

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      initContainers:
        - name: 
          ...
      containers:
        - name: vote
          ...
          command: ["/bin/sh"]
          args:
            - "-c"
            - "sleep 300"
# ADD THE SECTION BELOW:
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 80
            periodSeconds: 5
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
```
* Save the yaml file and apply the deployment

```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/K8s-Orchestration-GCP/K8s-app-deploy-test/manifests/Deployments/voting-app1-deployment.yaml
```
<br>

### Observe Probe Behavior

**Rerun the curl command to see where the request is being sent.**
```bash
# Only rerun if the curl pod has terminated or if you want to delete it and recreate it
kubectl run curl --image=curlimages/curl -it -- sh

# Exit out of the shell after it is created
exit

# Run the curl command
for i in {1..500}; do
kubectl exec curl -it -- sh -c 'test=`wget -qO- -T 2  http://<EXTERNAL-IP>:8080 2>&1 | grep -E "container ID"` && echo "$test OK" || echo "Failed"'
done

```

The pod is running but removed from the Service endpoints — no traffic reaches it.  Your output should now look like this:
```          
          Processed by container ID vote2-fd6d6975f-5hmvc OK
          Processed by container ID vote2-fd6d6975f-5hmvc OK

          Processed by container ID vote2-fd6d6975f-5hmvc OK
          Processed by container ID vote2-fd6d6975f-5hmvc OK
          
```
Investigate the pod by doing a `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` and observe the events for notice of the readiness probe failure.
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

```
**Event Log:**
```
 Warning  Unhealthy  8s (x25 over 2m8s)  kubelet            spec.containers{vote}: Readiness probe failed: Get "http://10.64.0.15:80/": dial tcp 10.64.0.15:80: connect: connection refused

## 10. Rolling Updates and Rollback

**Concept:** Kubernetes can update a running Deployment to a new image version with zero downtime by gradually replacing old pods with new ones. If the new version is broken, you can roll back to the previous version instantly.

### Trigger a Rolling Update
Update the image on the postgres db-deployment: [old Image: `redis:redis`] [new Image: `redis:latest`]
```bash
# Simulate updating to a new image version
kubectl set image deployment/redis redis=redis:latest 

# Watch the rollout - wait for it to complete successfully
kubectl rollout status deployment/redis   
````
A successful rollout message will be display `deployment "redis" successfully rolled out`

Kubernetes brings up new pods before terminating old ones — traffic continues during the update.  There are a few ways to verify the update:

1. Confirm that the pod is running and a new image has been set:
```bash
# Check for running pods
kubectl get pods

# Check that the image has been updated
kubectl describe pod <redis-pod-name>  | grep Image:
````
2. Observe that the pod was brought up first before scaling down the old ones:
```bash
# Get deployments
kubectl get deployments

# View deployment events
kubectl describe deployment/redis
```
```
 Type    Reason             Age    From                   Message
  ----    ------             ----   ----                   -------
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  4m39s  deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set redis-6f5f7488 from 0 to 1
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  4m34s  deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set redis-7bb95dd47b from 1 to 0

- The pod was brough up on the new image before the old ones were terminated.

```
3. Confirm the application is still working
```
The votes are still updating in the results UI.
```
4. View the deployment history
```bash
# Show deployment history
kubectl rollout history deployment/redis
```

```
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
2         <none>

This shows that we went from revision 1 to revision 2.
```


### Simulate a Bad Deploy
```bash
# Set a non-existent image tag
kubectl set image deployment/redis redis=redis:latest-bad 

# Watch it fail
kubectl get pods  -w

# New pods will show ImagePullBackOff
NAME                      READY   STATUS             RESTARTS      AGE
db-9bf4d5686-d46ct        1/1     Running            0             24m
redis-6d4d567d94-82wqn    0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0             19s

```

### Roll Back
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/redis 

# Confirm recovery
kubectl rollout status deployment/vote 
kubectl get pods 

# Confirm the rollback to the previous version was successful
kubectl describe pod <redis-pod-name>  | grep Image:

```

> **Why this matters:** This is the fundamental operational loop in any Kubernetes environment — deploy, verify, rollback if needed. GitLab Dedicated automates this at scale across hundreds of environments; understanding the manual version is the prerequisite.

## 11. Debugging — What Breaks and How to Fix It

**Concept:** Knowing *how* to read failure signals is as important as knowing how to deploy. These are the most common failure modes typically observed in real Kubernetes work.

### The Four Common Failures

#### CrashLoopBackOff
The container starts, crashes, Kubernetes restarts it, it crashes again.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n voting           # See CrashLoopBackOff in STATUS
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n voting    # Read the crash output
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n voting --previous   # Logs from the last crash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n voting      # Check Events and Last State
```

**Common causes:** bad command/entrypoint, missing environment variable, failed DB connection on startup.

#### ***EXAMPLE:***
```
If you try to create a database deployment using a persistent volume claim (PVC) that has not been created yet, 
the deployment will succeed and the mountpath will be created. Any subsequent attempts after this initial success 
will fail with CrashLoopBackOff.
```

-------------------------------------------------
[ CHECK EVENTS AND LAST STATE ]


```bash
% kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

```

Events:
  ...
Warning  BackOff                 2s (x6 over 2m23s)   kubelet                  spec.containers{postgres}:
   Back-off restarting failed container postgres in pod db-6447848995-t4bls_voting(24ef790c-cfb0-441c-9d9a-45392433b768)
```

-------------------------------------------------
[ CHECK POD LOGS ]

```bash
% kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

```
initdb: error: directory "/var/lib/postgresql/data" exists but is not empty
initdb: detail: It contains a lost+found directory, perhaps due to it being a mount point.
initdb: hint: Using a mount point directly as the data directory is not recommended.
```

-------------------------------------------------
[ EXPLANATION & RESOLUTION ]

```
You won't be able to initialize a new database target directory to save persistent data if that folder is not empty.
This is a requiremnt meant to prevent accidental data overwrite. The path initially used in this case is also
the mount path for the volume. Typically, the lost+found folder is created in the root path of the volume.
So using this root path as the mount path is not recommended. The fix is to add a subpath to the root path
in the db deployment yaml ensuring only database data is created and written to that location.
```
> See [Persistent Storage for PostgreSQL](#8-persistent-storage-for-postgresql) for adding subpath to db deployment

<br>

#### ImagePullBackOff
Kubernetes can't pull the container image.

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n voting
# Look at Events: "Failed to pull image ... not found"
```

**Common causes:** typo in image name or tag, private registry credentials missing.

#### OOMKilled
The container exceeded its memory limit and was killed by the kernel.

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n voting
# Look for: Last State: Terminated, Reason: OOMKilled
```

**Fix:** Increase the memory limit in the Deployment spec.

#### Pending (Unschedulable)
The pod cannot be placed on any node.

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n voting
# Look for: Events: 0/3 nodes are available: Insufficient cpu
```

**Common causes:** resource requests too high for available nodes, or no nodes with the required labels.

### Debugging Quick Reference

| Symptom | First Command | What to Look For |
|---|---|---|
| Pod not starting | `kubectl describe pod <name>` | Events section at the bottom |
| Pod crashing | `kubectl logs <name> --previous` | Crash output / error message |
| Can't reach service | `kubectl get endpoints <svc>` | No endpoints = no ready pods |
| General confusion | `kubectl get events --sort-by=.lastTimestamp` | Most recent cluster events |

## 12. Cleanup

When finished, tear down the cluster to avoid ongoing GCP charges.

```bash
# Delete all resources in the namespace first
kubectl delete namespace voting

# Delete the GKE cluster
gcloud container clusters delete voting-cluster --zone us-central1-a
```

## 13. What I Would Do Next

This project covers the foundational layer. The following represents the natural progression into intermediate and advanced SRE Kubernetes work — documented in [`README-advanced.md`](./README-advanced.md):

| Next Step | Concept |
|---|---|
| Add HorizontalPodAutoscaler | Scale vote pods automatically under load |
| Add RBAC | Create scoped ServiceAccounts and Roles |
| Add NetworkPolicy | Restrict pod-to-pod communication by namespace |
| Deploy to AWS EKS and Azure AKS | Multi-cloud portability, StorageClass differences |
| Provision cluster with Terraform | Declarative, repeatable infrastructure-as-code |
| Add Helm | Package and template the full app as a reusable chart |
| Add Prometheus + Grafana | Production-grade observability beyond `kubectl top` |

The advanced outline is intentionally documented to show awareness of where this work leads — not as a claim that it's already complete.
